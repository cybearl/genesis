Genesis is an advanced cryptocurrency trading toolbox, aiming to provide a lot of different tools
and features around the cryptocurrency space.

## Features
- [ ] A powerful and easy-to-use bot system with predefined and custom strategies.
- [ ] A fast BTC and ETH address generator (a bit similar to [Celk](https://github.com/yoratoni/celk)).
- [ ] The capacity to paper trade (or dry-run) yourself and your bots.
- [ ] The `discovery` mode, which will allow you to find the best opportunities on the market.
- [ ] A lot of different tools and features around the cryptocurrency space.

## Updates:
**Note:** I care about the Open-Source community,
that's why this repo is public, but it is not aimed to be a commercial product,
neither a product for the community, I'm doing this for personal use,
and I'm sharing it with the community because I think it could be interesting
or some people.

#### Update: 12/2023
I've decided to switch to Electron for the bot itself, I started this bot with a too complex architecture,
and I want it to be more user-friendly, and as it is fully open-source, I don't see any reason to bind it
to a web interface, so I'm switching to Electron, which will allow me to make a better UI and UX.

#### Update: 03/2024
Working on the interface and the overall design of the app, still thinking a lot about what kind of
features should be implemented (as a reminder, I'm doing this for personal use, even if it's damn interesting,
there's still thousand of more interesting crypto toolboxes and bots out there).

Now, here's a quick list of features I'm thinking about:
- [ ] A settings page to configure the app itself
- [ ] A status bar to see some information about the network, Binance API, etc..
- [ ] A sandbox mode (which i called `dry-run sandbox` for now, made to test bots without using real money).
- [ ] An account page (LOCAL only), made to secure the app itself, and to possibly add a Binance API key.
- [ ] A bot page, to see the current bots running, and to add new ones.
- [ ] I plan to implement a system that watch a lot of different cryptos at the same time to find the best
  opportunities (even for manual trading, it could be interesting).
