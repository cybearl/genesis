Todo list:
- [x] Replace the MongoDB instance by a local JSON file when Mongo environment variables are not set.
- [x] In the case of a crash (connection lost, etc.), find a way to use the last trade position instead
      of the initial balance parameter.
- [x] Use Chart.JS & ChartJS-Node-Canvas to generate a chart image of the last trades and export it to a file.*
      Will be stored in the "utils" folder and images exported in the "charts" folder.
